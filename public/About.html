<h1>About Me</h1><hr> 

<p>My name is <b>Binyaamin Adil Khan</b>, and I am an aspiring Web Developer and student currently building my skills in modern web technologies.<br> I have a strong interest in creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites, and I am continuously learning through hands-on practice and real-world projects.<br>

Alongside my academic journey, I am passionate about fitness, discipline, and personal growth.<br> I believe in <b>consistency</b>, whether it's in my studies, coding practice, or achieving my fitness goals.<br> My long-term aim is to develop both a strong technical foundation and a well-balanced lifestyle.

I am particularly focused on improving my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and building a deeper understanding of front-end development.<br> As a beginner in the field, I approach every project as an opportunity to learn, grow, and work with attention to detail.

I am motivated, quick to adapt, and committed to improving myself every day — both as a developer and as an individual.
